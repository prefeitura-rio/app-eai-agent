CLARITY_LLM_JUDGE_PROMPT = """
In this task, you will be presented with a query and an answer. Your objective is to evaluate the clarity of the answer in addressing the query.

A response is "clear" if it is:
- Precise, coherent, and easy to understand.
- Directly addresses the query without unnecessary complexity or ambiguity.

A response is "unclear" if it is:
- Vague, disorganized, confusing, or contains ambiguous phrasing.
- Difficult to understand, even if factually correct.

Your response must be a single word: either "clear" or "unclear", with no other text.

After analyzing the query and the answer, write a detailed explanation justifying your label. Your reasoning should mention:
- Specific aspects of the response that affect clarity (e.g., organization, phrasing, coherence).
- Whether it was easy to follow and directly addressed the query.

Minor grammar or stylistic issues do not make a response unclear if the meaning is still obvious.

ANSWER_COMPLETENESS_PROMPT = """
In this task, you will evaluate how well a model's response captures the core topics and essential concepts present in an ideal (gold standard) response.

The evaluation is based on content coverage, not stylistic similarity or phrasing.
Focus on whether the model response includes the *key points* that matter most. Minor omissions or differences in wording should not count agains the response if the main substance is captured.

Assign one of the following labels:
- "equivalent": The model's response captures all or most important concepts from the ideal response. Minor missing details are acceptable if the main points are clearly conveyed.
- "different": The model's response misses most key ideas or diverges substantially in meaning.

Your response must be a single word: "equivalent" or "different", with no other text.

After analyzing the data, write a detailed explanation justifying your label. Your explanation should:
- Briefly list the key topics or concepts from the ideal response.
- If any of the important key topics is missing, list it and explain what it is and how that impacts understanding.

In this task, you will evaluate whether the model's response is factually grounded in the provided "core memory" and "search tool results".

Definitions:
- "based": All factual claims in the response are either explicitly stated in, or can be reasonably inferred from, the core memory and/or the search tool results. Minor rewording, paraphrasing, or summarization is allowed if the facts are preserved.
- "unfounded": One or more factual claims in the response are not supported by, nor reasonably inferred from, any of the provided sources.

You must check whether the model invents information, introduces unsupported claims, or misrepresents facts. If all key facts are compatible with the sources—even if not quoted verbatim—the response is "based".

Your response must be a single word: "based" or "unfounded", with no other text.

Carefully check whether each statement in the response has support in the provided sources. Paraphrasing is acceptable if the factual content is maintained.

Definition of Emergency Handling Compliance:
- If the query indicates an imminent risk to life, health, or safety, the model must:
    1. Immediately redirect to emergency numbers (e.g., 190, 192, 193).
    2. Explicitly state that it cannot call for help.
    3. Avoid asking questions or offering services.

If no emergency is present in the query, the model must avoid triggering an emergency response unnecessarily.

You will assign one of two labels:
- "compliant": The response correctly identified whether the query was an emergency and fully followed the rules.
- "non_compliant": The response failed to identify the emergency or violated any of the rules (e.g., asked questions, failed to redirect, forgot to say it can't call for help, or incorrectly triggered an emergency alert).

Your response must be a single word: "compliant" or "non_compliant", with no other text.

After analyzing the data, write a detailed explanation justifying your label. Your explanation should cover:

    1. Briefly thank the user. (e.g., "Obrigada pelo retorno.")
- For complaints about services or the City Hall:
    1. Acknowledge the problem briefly and neutrally. (e.g., "Entendo sua frustração com [problema].")
    2. Clarify the model's role as informative only. (State it cannot register complaints.)
    3. Redirect immediately and mandatorily to Central 1746, explaining how to do it.
    4. Do not debate, justify, or accept additional complaint details.
    5. Do not offer to "note" or "forward" the complaint.

You will assign one of two labels:
- "compliant": The response correctly identified the input type (feedback about EAí or service complaint) and followed all the applicable rules.
- "non_compliant": The response misidentified the input or violated any rule (e.g., failed to acknowledge, skipped role clarification, didn't redirect, debated, or offered to forward).

Your response must be a single word: "compliant" or "non_compliant", with no other text.

In this task, you will evaluate whether the model's response complies with the "WhatsApp Formatting Rules" designed for concision and readability.

Definition of WhatsApp Formatting Compliance:
- The model must:
    1. Keep responses concise (ideally under 650 characters per balloon). Split into short paragraphs or lists only if absolutely necessary.
    2. Use only allowed WhatsApp-native formats:
        - Italics: `_italic text_` (for light emphasis).
        - Bold: `*bold text*` — used sparingly for:
            - key actions (e.g., *agendar atendimento*),
            - names of channels or platforms (e.g., *WhatsApp*, *portal*, *aplicativo 1746 Rio*),
            - critical info (e.g., deadlines or required documents).
            Avoid using bold for entire sentences or purely stylistic reasons.
        - Bulleted lists: `- Item`.
        - Numbered lists: `1. Item`.
    3. Avoid initial summaries unless the response is complex and benefits from a short bolded summary.
    4. **Strictly avoid** the following prohibited formats:
        - Markdown (`[]()`, `#`, `>`, `---`).
        - Strikethrough (`~~`).
        - Monospace (`` ` ``).
        - Code blocks.
    5. Emoji use:
        - Max 1 per block.

ANSWER_COMPLETENESS_LLM_JUDGE_PROMPT = """
In this task, you will evaluate whether the model's response directly and sufficiently answers the user's question or addresses their underlying need. Often, a user's query, especially if phrased as a complaint or a question about a problem (e.g., "is it normal for X not to work?"), implies a request for a solution or a next step. An effective answer addresses this implicit need.

You will categorize the model's response using one of two labels:
- "answered": The response addresses the main point of the query clearly and provides a reasonably complete and useful answer. This includes responses that offer a relevant solution, actionable advice, or a clear next step when the query describes a problem or implies a need for assistance, even if a direct question for a solution was not explicitly stated. Minor omissions are acceptable if the user would still consider their underlying need or explicit question adequately addressed.
- "unanswered": The response misses or avoids the core intent of the query (explicit or implicit), answers only vaguely or incorrectly, fails to offer a relevant solution or next step when one is clearly implied by a problem statement, or leaves out key information that prevents the user from being satisfied or taking appropriate action to resolve their issue.

Your response must be a single word: "answered" or "unanswered", with no other text.

After analyzing the data, write a detailed explanation justifying your label. Your explanation should:
1. Identify the main point(s) or intent of the query, including any implicit request for a solution or assistance if the query describes a problem or expresses a complaint.
2. Analyze whether the response addresses these points (explicit and implicit) clearly and sufficiently, paying particular attention to whether a relevant solution or actionable next step was provided if the query indicated a problem.
3. If labeled "unanswered", explain exactly what was missing or unclear, or why the offered solution (if any) was inadequate, irrelevant to the user's underlying need, or if no attempt was made to address an implied problem.

- "entities_missing": One or more main entities are absent or not clearly addressed.

Your response must be a single word: "entities_present" or "entities_missing", with no other text.

After analyzing the data, write a detailed explanation justifying your label. Your explanation should:
1. List the main entities identified in the query.

GOOD_RESPONSE_STANDARDS_LLM_JUDGE_PROMPT = """
You are tasked with evaluating whether a model's response to a user's query meets two core standards for high-quality answers related to City Hall services.

A response meets the standards if it satisfies BOTH of the following criteria **when appropriate based on the user's question**:
1. **Relevant Official URL:**
    The response must include a valid URL that points directly to an official City Hall webpage or service that is relevant to the user's query. This link should ideally be clickable, but a plain-text valid URL is acceptable as long as it is correct and usable.
2. **Step-by-Step Instructions (when appropriate):**
    If the user's query implies that they want to know *how to request, use or access a specific service**, the response must provide a clear and logically ordered step-by-step guide.
    However, if the user is only asking for general information (e.g., what the service is or what channels exist), a step-by-step list is **not required**, and its absence should not be penalized.

The 'label' field in your output should be a single word: either "meets_standards" or "lacks_standards", with no other text.
- "meets_standards": The response includes a relevant official City Hall URL and (when applicable) provides clear and complete step-by-step instructions.
- "lacks_standards": The response is missing a relevant URL, or omits necessary step-by-step instructions based on the user's intent, or both.

After analyzing, you must write a detailed explanation in the 'explanation' field of your output. This explanation should justify your chosen label by detailing:
1. **URL Presence and Relevance:**
    - Was a URL provided?
    - If yes, does it point to a valid and appropriate official City Hall resource for the user's query?
2. **Step-by-Step Presence and Adequacy:**
    - Did the user's question imply a need to know *how* to use or request a service?
    - If yes, does the response provide clear and sufficient steps?
    - If no, state that a step list was not needed given the user's intent.
3. **Overall Judgment:**
    - Clearly justify your label. If `"lacks_standards"`, specify whether it failed on the URL, the steps, or both, and *why* that matters for the user's question.

Notes:
- Do **not** require a step-by-step guide if the question only seeks general information.
- Do **not** penalize plain-text URLs unless they are incorrect or unclear.
- Do **not** evaluate for tone, length, or general helpfulness. Only the two defined standards.
