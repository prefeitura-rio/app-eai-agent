DO NOT use multiple asterisks or spaces between the asterisk and the text to be bolded (INCORRECT examples: `**text**`, `* text *`, `*text *`). The asterisk must be attached to the first and last word of the section to be bolded. Use with extreme caution and intention, exclusively to highlight critical/essential information (e.g.: Mandatory Documents, Deadline, Free of charge, emergency/phone numbers, important links). Do not use for entire sentences just for style.\n- Bulleted Lists: Start the line with a hyphen followed by a space (`- List Item`).\n- Numbered Lists: Start the line with a number, period and space (`1. List Item`).\nInitial Summary: Avoid, unless the answer is complex and a 1-line summary in bold really helps in immediate comprehension.\nPROHIBITED Formats: NEVER use Markdown (`[]()`, `#`, `##`, ``` ```, `double **bold**`, `> Quote`, `---`), Strikethrough (`~~`), Monospace (````).\nEmojis (MAXIMUM 1 per block, relevant, SUBTLE): Use with extreme moderation. DO NOT USE in emergencies or when dealing with complaints.\n---\n\nYou will categorize the model's response using one of two labels:\n- \"compliant_format\": The model's response adheres to all specified WhatsApp formatting rules regarding length, allowed formats (italics, bold, lists with correct syntax and usage), prohibited formats, and emoji usage.\n- \"non_compliant_format\": The model's response violates one or more of the specified WhatsApp formatting rules.\n\nYour response should be a single word: either \"compliant_format\" or \"non_compliant_format,\" and it should not include any other text or characters.\n\nPlease meticulously examine the model's response against each rule:\n1.  **Length and Conciseness**: Is it concise? Does it likely fit within a single WhatsApp balloon (<~650 chars)? Is it broken up appropriately if long?\n2.  **Allowed Formats**:\n    *   Are italics (`_text_`) used correctly, if at all?\n    *   Is bold (`*text*`) used correctly (single asterisks, attached, for critical info only, not entire sentences), if at all?\n    *   Are bulleted (`- Item`) or numbered lists (`1. Item`) used correctly, if at all?\n3.  **Initial Summary**: Is an initial summary avoided, or appropriately used if the answer is complex?\n4.  **Prohibited Formats**: Does the response avoid all prohibited Markdown, strikethrough, and monospace?\n5.  **Emojis**: If used, is it a maximum of 1 per block, relevant, subtle, and not used in emergency/complaint contexts (consider the query for this)?\n\nAfter analyzing the data, you must write a detailed explanation of your reasoning to justify why you chose either \"compliant_format\" or \"non_compliant_format.\" Avoid stating the final label at the beginning of your explanation. If \"non_compliant_format,\" your reasoning should clearly identify which specific formatting rule(s) were violated and how. Provide examples from the response if possible.\n\n[BEGIN DATA]\nQuery: {query}\nModel Response: {model_response}\n[END DATA]\nPlease analyze the data carefully and provide an explanation followed by your response.\n\nexplanation: Provide your reasoning step by step. Meticulously evaluate the model's response against each rule in the \"Whatsapp Formatting Rules\" section (Length, Allowed Formats - Italics, Bold, Lists, Initial Summary, Prohibited Formats, Emojis).

Your objective is to evaluate how well the model's response captures the core topics and essential concepts present in the ideal response. The evaluation is not about stylistic similarity or exact phrasing, but about the substantial overlap of key information.\n\nYou will categorize the model's response into one of three labels:\n- \"equivalent\": The model's response comprehensively covers all the core topics and essential concepts present in the ideal response. It doesn't need to be a word-for-word match, but the key information and themes must be fully represented.\n- \"similar\": The model's response addresses some, but not all, of the core topics and essential concepts from the ideal response. There's a partial overlap in the key information.\n- \"different\": The model's response covers very few or none of the core topics and essential concepts from the ideal response. The main message or substance diverges significantly.\n\nYour response should be a single word: \"different\", \"similar\", or \"equivalent\", and it should not include any other text or characters.\n\nPlease carefully consider the query (for context), the model's response, and the ideal response before determining your evaluation. Focus on identifying the core topics in the ideal response and then checking their presence and completeness in the model's response.\n\nAfter analyzing all three pieces of information, you must write a detailed explanation of your reasoning to justify your chosen label.
