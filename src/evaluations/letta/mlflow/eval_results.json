The 'Handling User Feedback' section of the system prompt provides specific instructions for two types of user input: feedback about the model itself (EAí) and complaints about services/City Hall. The user's input does not fall into either of these categories; it is not feedback about the model, nor is it a complaint expressing frustration or a problem. Therefore, the conditions for applying the 'Handling User Feedback' instructions were not met. The model's response correctly identified the input as an informational query and provided relevant information and links to official channels. It did not attempt to apply the feedback handling steps (like acknowledging frustration, clarifying its role in handling complaints, or redirecting specifically for complaint registration via 1746). By not applying the feedback handling instructions when they were not applicable, the model acted in accordance with the system prompt's design for handling different types of user input. Thus, the model's response is compliant with the overall system prompt logic, including the implicit condition that the feedback handling instructions are only triggered by specific input types.",

Prefer answers that fit in a balloon. Break up long texts only if absolutely necessary, using paragraphs or short lists. Avoid long texts.\nAllowed Formats:\n- Italics: Surround the text with an underscore on each side (`_italic text_`). Use for light emphasis.\n- Bold: Surround the text with exactly one asterisk on each side (`*bold text*`). DO NOT use multiple asterisks or spaces between the asterisk and the text to be bolded (INCORRECT examples: `**text**`, `* text *`, `*text *`). The asterisk must be attached to the first and last word of the section to be bolded. Use with extreme caution and intention, exclusively to highlight critical/essential information (e.g.: Mandatory Documents, Deadline, Free of charge, emergency/phone numbers, important links). Do not use for entire sentences just for style.\n- Bulleted Lists: Start the line with a hyphen followed by a space (`- List Item`).\n- Numbered Lists: Start the line with a number, period and space (`1. List Item`).\nInitial Summary: Avoid, unless the answer is complex and a 1-line summary in bold really helps in immediate comprehension.\nPROHIBITED Formats: NEVER use Markdown (`[]()`, `#`, `##`, ``` ```, `double **bold**`, `> Quote`, `---`), Strikethrough (`~~`), Monospace (````).\nEmojis (MAXIMUM 1 per block, relevant, SUBTLE): Use with extreme moderation.

Item`) used correctly, if at all?\n3.  **Initial Summary**: Is an initial summary avoided, or appropriately used if the answer is complex?\n4.  **Prohibited Formats**: Does the response avoid all prohibited Markdown, strikethrough, and monospace?\n5.  **Emojis**: If used, is it a maximum of 1 per block, relevant, subtle, and not used in emergency/complaint contexts (consider the query for this)?\n\nAfter analyzing the data, you must write a detailed explanation of your reasoning to justify why you chose either \"compliant_format\" or \"non_compliant_format.\" Avoid stating the final label at the beginning of your explanation.
