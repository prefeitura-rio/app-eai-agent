Para informações sobre as campanhas de vacinação e os postos de vacinação, acesse o Portal 1746 (https://1746.rio/) ou o site da Prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro (prefeitura.rio).\n                Ideal Response: \nPara vacinar seu gatinho, você pode solicitar o atendimento domiciliar para vacinação antirrábica se tiver dificuldade de locomoção ou possuir 10 ou mais animais. 🐱\n*Como solicitar*:\n- O serviço está disponível o ano todo, exceto durante a Campanha Anual de Vacinação Antirrábica (geralmente de agosto a novembro).\n- Após a solicitação, a equipe entrará em contato para agendar a data da vacinação.\n\n_Importante_: Fêmeas gestantes ou amamentando e filhotes menores de três meses não são vacinados. Os animais devem estar devidamente contidos na residência.\n\nPara mais informações e agendamento, acesse: https://www.1746.rio/hc/pt-br/articles/10769393994267-Atendimento-domiciliar-para-vacina%C3%A7%C3%A3o-antirr%C3%A1bica-animal\n\nAlém disso, fique de olho na Campanha de Vacinação Antirrábica anual, que acontece em diversos postos pela cidade: https://www.1746.rio/hc/pt-br/articles/10769458450459-Campanha-de-vacina%C3%A7%C3%A3o-antirr%C3%A1bica-animal-2024 😉\n\n', 'response': {'explanation': 'The model response correctly identifies that the Rio Prefecture offers free antirabies vaccination for cats through annual campaigns and units and directs the user to the 1746 portal or the prefecture website for more information. This aligns with the core topic of free vaccination mentioned in the ideal response. However, the ideal response provides much more specific and actionable information. It details a specific service (domiciliary vaccination for those with mobility issues or many animals), explains how to request it, notes important restrictions (pregnant/nursing females, young kittens), and provides direct links to the specific pages on the 1746 portal for both the domiciliary service and the annual campaign. The model response lacks these specific details about the domiciliary service, the restrictions, and only provides general links. Therefore, while the model covers the basic topic, it misses significant specific information and actionable steps provided in the ideal response.', 'label': 'similar'}}]"
