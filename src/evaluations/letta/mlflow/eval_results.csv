Os animais devem estar devidamente contidos na residência.\n\nPara mais informações e agendamento, acesse: https://www.1746.rio/hc/pt-br/articles/10769393994267-Atendimento-domiciliar-para-vacina%C3%A7%C3%A3o-antirr%C3%A1bica-animal\n\nAlém disso, fique de olho na Campanha de Vacinação Antirrábica anual, que acontece em diversos postos pela cidade: https://www.1746.rio/hc/pt-br/articles/10769458450459-Campanha-de-vacina%C3%A7%C3%A3o-antirr%C3%A1bica-animal-2024 😉\n\n', 'response': {'explanation': 'The ideal response provides specific details about how to get a cat vaccinated in Rio, focusing on two main options: domiciliary vaccination (explaining eligibility, process, and exclusions like age or pregnancy) and the annual campaign, providing direct links for both. The model response is much more general. It mentions free vaccination, the antirabies vaccine, annual campaigns, and veterinary units, but it does not mention the domiciliary service at all, nor does it provide the important exclusions or requirements mentioned in the ideal response. The links provided by the model are general links to the 1746 portal and the city hall website, whereas the ideal response provides direct links to the specific pages for the domiciliary service and the campaign. While the model correctly identifies that free vaccination is available and mentions the campaign, it misses significant specific and actionable information present in the ideal response.', 'label': 'similar'}}]"
