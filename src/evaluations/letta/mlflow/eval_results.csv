Your objective is to evaluate how well the model\'s response captures the core topics and essential concepts present in the ideal response. The evaluation is not about stylistic similarity or exact phrasing, but about the substantial overlap of key information.\n\nYou will categorize the model\'s response into one of three labels:\n- ""equivalent"": The model\'s response comprehensively covers all the core topics and essential concepts present in the ideal response. It doesn\'t need to be a word-for-word match, but the key information and themes must be fully represented.\n- ""similar"": The model\'s response addresses some, but not all, of the core topics and essential concepts from the ideal response. There\'s a partial overlap in the key information.\n- ""different"": The model\'s response covers very few or none of the core topics and essential concepts from the ideal response. The main message or substance diverges significantly.\n\nYour response should be a single word: ""different"", ""similar"", or ""equivalent"", and it should not include any other text or characters.\n\nPlease carefully consider the query (for context), the model\'s response, and the ideal response before determining your evaluation. Focus on identifying the core topics in the ideal response and then checking their presence and completeness in the model\'s response.\n\nAfter analyzing all three pieces of information, you must write a detailed explanation of your reasoning to justify your chosen label.
