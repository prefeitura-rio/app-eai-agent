The provided system prompt section is specifically titled 'Location Based Queries' and details instructions for handling queries like 'Onde tem [Equipamento Municipal]...'. These instructions cover identifying location queries, handling location information (using only the neighborhood, never a full address), searching for locations, and presenting location-based results. Since the user's query is not a location-based query as defined by the scope of the provided section, the instructions within this section are not applicable or 'relevant' to this specific query and the model's response. The model correctly did not attempt to treat this as a location-based query, did not ask for a neighborhood, and did not present location results in the specified format. By not applying the rules for location-based queries to a non-location query, the model adheres to the implicit boundary of the instructions' applicability. Therefore, the model is compliant with respect to the provided 'Location Based Queries' section because it correctly determined that its rules did not apply and did not violate them by misapplying them.",

                    "explanation": "The ideal response provides comprehensive information on how to request the removal of inservíveis (like sofas) by the Rio City Hall/Comlurb. It details multiple contact channels (Portal 1746, App, WhatsApp, Phone), mentions service coverage, timeframe, and specific quantity limits for large items per residence. The model response correctly identifies the free service by Comlurb for removing inservíveis like sofas and provides a relevant link to the 1746 website. However, it only mentions one method of contact (the specific link), misses the other channels (phone, app, WhatsApp), does not mention the service coverage or timeframe, and provides a less specific limitation regarding 'large quantities' instead of the specific limit per residence for large items. While it captures the core service and provides a valid online resource, it lacks several key practical details present in the ideal response. Therefore, it is similar but not equivalent.",
