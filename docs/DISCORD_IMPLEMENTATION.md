# Discord Notifications Implementation

This implementation adds Discord notifications for new prompt versions uploaded to production. The system automatically sends rich notifications to a Discord channel whenever someone uploads a new prompt version in the production environment.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Components Added

1. **Discord Service** (`src/services/discord/`)
   - `notification_service.py` - Main Discord notification logic
   - `__init__.py` - Module initialization

2. **Schemas** (`src/schemas/discord_schema.py`)
   - Pydantic models for Discord webhook payloads
   - Type safety for Discord API integration

3. **Configuration** (`src/config/env.py`)
   - Added `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` and `ENVIRONMENT` variables
   - Environment-based configuration management

4. **Integration Point** (`src/api/v1/unified_save.py`)
   - Modified to trigger Discord notifications
   - Non-blocking notification sending

5. **Documentation**
   - Setup guides and deployment instructions
   - Testing scripts and troubleshooting

6. **Tests** (`tests/unit/services/discord/`)
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all Discord functionality

## 🔧 Key Features

### Production-Only Notifications
- Notifications are ONLY sent when `ENVIRONMENT=production` (or "prod")
- Prevents spam during development and testing
- Configurable and secure

### Rich Discord Messages
Each notification includes:
- 🤖 Agent Type
- 📦 Version Display Name
- 🔢 Version Number  
- 👤 Author
- 🔄 Change Type (prompt, config, both)
- 📝 Reason for change
- 📄 Prompt content preview (first 200 characters)
- ⏰ Timestamp
- 🎨 Color-coded embeds

### Error Handling
- Failed Discord notifications don't affect prompt uploads
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful fallbacks for missing configuration

### Security
- Webhook URLs stored as environment variables
- No secrets in code or configuration files
- Production environment validation

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Discord Webhook Setup

1. Create a Discord webhook in your desired channel:
   - Right-click channel → Edit Channel → Integrations → Create Webhook
   - Copy the webhook URL

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

Add to your production environment:

```bash
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Production

Update your Kubernetes secret (recommended approach):

```bash
# Update the secret with Discord configuration
kubectl create secret generic eai-agent-secrets \
  --from-literal=DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" \
  --from-literal=ENVIRONMENT="production" \
  --from-env-file=existing_vars.env \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# Restart deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment eai-agent
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Upload a new prompt version through the admin interface
2. Check your Discord channel for the notification
3. Verify logs show successful notification sending

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
Use the test script to verify configuration:

```bash
python scripts/test_discord_notifications.py
```

### Unit Tests
Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run Discord service tests
pytest tests/unit/services/discord/ -v

# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Integration Testing
1. Set up a test Discord webhook
2. Temporarily set `ENVIRONMENT=production` in development
3. Upload a prompt version and verify notification
4. **Remember to revert environment settings!**

## 📊 Message Flow

```
User uploads prompt → Unified Save API → Discord Service → Discord Channel
                           ↓
                      Production Check → Environment Check → Send Notification
                           ↓
                    Log Success/Failure → Continue with upload process
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No Notifications Received
1. Check `ENVIRONMENT=production` is set
2. Verify `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is correct
3. Ensure Discord webhook is still active
4. Check application logs for errors

### Common Log Messages
- `"Discord notification sent successfully"` ✅ Success
- `"Discord webhook URL not configured"` ⚠️ Missing webhook URL
- `"Not in production environment"` ⚠️ Not production (expected in dev)
- `"Failed to send Discord notification"` ❌ Error occurred

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Webhook URL Security**: Treat as a secret, never commit to version control
2. **Environment Validation**: Only production environments send notifications
3. **Error Handling**: Failures don't expose sensitive information
4. **Access Control**: Only authorized users can upload prompt versions

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Production Only**: Notifications are ONLY sent in production environment
- **Non-Blocking**: Failed notifications don't affect prompt uploads
- **Secure**: Webhook URLs are stored as environment variables
- **Tested**: Comprehensive unit tests ensure reliability
- **Documented**: Full setup and troubleshooting documentation provided

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
- Batch notifications for multiple rapid uploads
- User mention support for specific authors
- Different notification channels for different agent types
- Notification templates for different event types
- Integration with other communication platforms (Slack, Teams)

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section in `docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS.md`
2. Review application logs for error messages
3. Verify environment configuration
4. Test with the provided test script

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and production-ready Discord notification system for prompt version uploads.
