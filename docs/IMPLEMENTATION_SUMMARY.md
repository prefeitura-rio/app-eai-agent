# Discord Notifications Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective Achieved
✅ **Successfully implemented Discord notifications for new prompt versions uploaded in production**

## 📋 Implementation Plan Completed

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅
- [x] Added Discord webhook configuration to `src/config/env.py`
- [x] Added environment detection capability (`ENVIRONMENT` variable)
- [x] Ensured production-only notifications with proper validation

### Phase 2: Core Service Development ✅
- [x] Created Discord notification service (`src/services/discord/notification_service.py`)
- [x] Implemented rich webhook messaging with embeds
- [x] Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] Created reusable Discord message and embed classes

### Phase 3: Integration ✅
- [x] Modified unified save endpoint (`src/api/v1/unified_save.py`)
- [x] Added production environment check
- [x] Included relevant prompt version information in notifications
- [x] Implemented non-blocking notification sending

### Phase 4: Schemas & Validation ✅
- [x] Created Discord-specific schemas (`src/schemas/discord_schema.py`)
- [x] Added proper data validation with Pydantic
- [x] Ensured Discord API compliance with field limits

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation ✅
- [x] Created comprehensive unit tests (`tests/unit/services/discord/`)
- [x] Built test script for manual verification (`scripts/test_discord_notifications.py`)
- [x] Wrote detailed setup documentation (`docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS.md`)
- [x] Created Kubernetes deployment guide (`docs/KUBERNETES_DISCORD_SETUP.md`)

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Production-Only Notifications
- Environment validation ensures notifications only in production
- Configurable via `ENVIRONMENT` variable
- Safe for development and staging environments

### 2. Rich Discord Messages
Every notification includes:
- 🤖 Agent Type
- 📦 Version Display Name (e.g., eai-2025-08-20-v1)
- 🔢 Version Number
- 👤 Author
- 🔄 Change Type (prompt, config, both)
- 📝 Reason for change
- 📄 Prompt content preview
- ⏰ Timestamp
- 🎨 Professional Discord embed formatting

### 3. Robust Error Handling
- Failed Discord notifications don't affect prompt uploads
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful fallbacks for missing configuration
- Non-blocking asynchronous operation

### 4. Security & Configuration
- Webhook URLs stored as environment variables
- No secrets in code
- Production environment validation
- Secure deployment practices documented

## 📝 Files Modified

### Configuration
- `src/config/env.py` - Added Discord environment variables

### API Integration
- `src/api/v1/unified_save.py` - Added Discord notification trigger

## 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Create Discord Webhook
```
Discord Channel → Edit Channel → Integrations → Create Webhook
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
```bash
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_ID/YOUR_TOKEN
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Update Kubernetes secret
kubectl create secret generic eai-agent-secrets \
  --from-literal=DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="YOUR_URL" \
  --from-literal=ENVIRONMENT="production" \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# Restart deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment eai-agent
```

### 4. Test the Integration
```bash
# Use test script
python scripts/test_discord_notifications.py

# Or upload a prompt version and check Discord
```
